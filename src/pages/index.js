            (aka "photomarathons") have been around for decades taking place in
            different cities all over the world. While every photo marathon is
            unique, they are all variations on the same basic idea:
          </p>
          <p>
            At a given date and time, photographers assemble at a chosen
            location and are given a theme for the hour. They then go out in the
            world, take a photo to interpret this theme, and submit it to the
            event. Then they return for the next hour to get another theme and
            so on. Over 12 hours, they produce 12 photos interpreting 12
            different themes.

            organizer Morten Rand-Hendriksen. Some people like running
            marathons, travelling internationally, or taking photos. Somewhere
            along the way Morten got things a bit mixed up and decided he wanted
            to organize a 24-hour international photo marathon instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Morten is curious to see how people around the globe will interpret
            the same 24 themes to develop uniquely different and creative
            images. The community of photographers and technologists working
            with him to produce this event are just as curious to see what you
            come up with!
